function [P, P_f, P_ub, Pub_f]= WecPower(Zi, Fe, C, Kt, R, N)
% WecPower  Calculates power based on impedance, Zi, excitation, Fe, and
% feedback controller, C (along with PTO specifications).
%
% Args:
%   Zi      impedance model (in: velocity, out: torque) with 
%           size(Zi) = [nDof,nDof,nFreq]
%   Fe      excitation spectrum with size(Fe) = [nDof, nFreq]
%   C       control model (in: velocity, out: torque) with 
%           size(C) = [nDof,nDof,nFreq]
%   Kt      torque constant with size(Kt) = [nDof, nDof] 
%           and isdiag(Kt) = 1
%   R       motor winding resistance with size(R) = [nDof, nDof] 
%           and isdiag(R) = 1
%   N       gear ratio (in: torque at motor, out: torque at body) with
%           size(N) = [nDof, nDof] and isdiag(N) = 1
